            <p>Vehicle Birds is the new kid on the block offering an outlandish way to pimp out your ride. Next up in the world of motor heads: flying cars! This hot new company offers kits for motor vehicles of all shapes and sizes. All you have to do is purchase one of their kits online, have it shipped to you, and follow the assembly instructions. Alternatively, you could pay an additional fee to have a licensed professional install the kit for you.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>This now opens up the world of flight to the everyday consumer for a fraction of the cost. With this development comes the question, is it safe? According to a joint study by the DMV and the FAA, the answer is a resounding yes! Vehicle Birds found a way to perfectly balance the resounding safety of drivers (or flyers) and those around them with a sleek look. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>How they did it? Through game changing use of nano technology the founders were able to create an ever changing "kit" that senses not only changes within the vehicle, but also the environment. With this gathered information it is then able to readjust to ensure the passengers have the best ride possible. Next up: The Ins and Outs of Nano Tech.</p>

            <p>From rolling in the mud to playing in the clouds! Vehicle Birds a car to helicopter conversion company recently just put out a new conversion kit that fits most vehicle trucks. This has been most popular seen on the RAM and Jeep trucks and has quickly become a fun new gadget for vehicle enthusiasts who enjoy mudding and off roading. These conversion kits are made of durable material to avoid getting damaged from the uneven terrain but still light enough to not add stress to your vehicle.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>During the red ribbon cutting of this new truck copter kit I was able to get a behind the scenes tour of where the magic happened. The Truck copter kits aren't the only thing that Vehicle Birds has in store, this company if working to produce a variety of model kits and are getting ready to release these top secret models soon! The founders, Brandon Townes, Melia Rodriguez and Melina Ramos spoke to me about the efforts their making to bring the cost down of this amazing product. "We want these kits to be available to an everyday user while also still providing great quality" said Brandon Townes the founding investor and head of AI Nanotechnology department. This will soon be the biggest trend to hit transportation as we know it.
